# En Passant

Welcome to our Github Repo!

The main point of our project is to implement a Chess Game web application where the user(s) can either create
and play a new match game of chess which will be then recorded onto the database, and/or view previous matches
using the match history page which is designed to load up the selected match, delete the selected game data from
the database, or edit the game name. When loading up the recorded matches, the user(s) are able to view step-by-
step of the game selected on the actual chessboard and are given the ability to manually control the next and
previous step of the game.
